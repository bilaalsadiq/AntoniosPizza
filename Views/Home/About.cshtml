            <hr />
            <p class="about-page-text">
                Antonios Pizza is a completely made up Pizzeria, based in a figment of my own imagination.
                <br /><br />
                The concept of the restaurant came from my own lockdown-induced cravings for Neapolitan Pizza and the Pizzeria environment, which then in turn resulted in the creation of an imaginary Pizzeria that exists only through this website.
                <br /><br />
                We are truly very sorry to have dissapointed you if you were expecting the real deal, however feel free to browse through the menu and also feed your imagination, as I have.

            <p class="about-page-text">
                This site was built to complete the requirements of the JustIT developers course, by creating a working eCommerce site with the basic functions. This application demonstrates my ability to learn, understand and create ASP.NET MVC web applications.
                <br /><br />
                The website loads data from multiple tables to display products from different categories. Users can add these to a "cart" which exists by virtue of "Sessions", and can be "Checked-out" once the customer is happy with their selections.
                <br /><br />
                In the back-end, on checkout - the application writes to two tables simultaneously - one to store the order record, and for each individual item, it adds a record to another table.
